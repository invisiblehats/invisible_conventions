# Our product development standards

We believe in creating products that are good; good design, good for humanity, and good for the planet.

## Ruby

**Includes**

- [Rubocop](https://www.rubocop.org/) to enforce code conventions

### Installation

Include this in your ruby project by adding this to your `Gemfile`

```bash
# Gemfile
gem 'invisible_standards'
```

You can also install this globally by running this command in your terminal

```bash
# on command line
gem install invisible_standards
```

### Rubocop

You can include [Rubocop](https://www.rubocop.org/) config files from gems. To include ours, add this to your local `.rubocop.yml`

```yml
# .rubocop.yml
inherit_gem:
  invisible_standards: ihv-rubocop.yml

The local set of rules will be added to your ruleset. Your local config will overwrite any options. Make sure to run it using local gems if you installed it using the `Gemfile` (`bundle exec rubocop`)
